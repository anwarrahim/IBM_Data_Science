While other libraries are available to visualize geospatial data, such as **plotly**, they might have a cap on how many API calls you can make within a defined time frame. **Folium**, on the other hand, is completely free.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1d0cb4fa-78f1-4db5-a400-5a4f3c209941","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Table of Contents\n","\n","\u003cdiv class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\"\u003e\n","\n","1.
