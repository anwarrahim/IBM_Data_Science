Peer-graded Assignment: Create and Share Your Jupyter Notebook
Effort: 20 mins

Objective:
In this final assignment, you will be able to learn:

Creating a Jupyter Notebook using Skills Network LTI item or Watson Studio environment.

Create Markdown cells.

Instructions
Congratulations on finishing all three modules of this course. This week, you'll work on your final assignment which will be graded by your peers.

This course introduced you to multiple data science tools, and in this final project, you will use Jupyter Notebook, one of the easiest tools to share publicly.

Include at least 6 cells:

Cell 1 (rendered as Markdown): The title should be "My Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio", in H1 header styling. The title does not need to be centered.

Cell 2 (rendered as Markdown): Include your name, in bold characters. In the line below your name, write your current or desired occupation in regular font.

Cell 3 (rendered as Markdown): In italic formatting, write one or two sentences about why you are interested in data science. For example, you can start your first sentence with "I am interested in data science because ...".

Cell 4 (rendered as Markdown): In H3 header styling, explain in a short sentence what your code is supposed to do in Cell 5.

Cell 5 (code cell): Your code, as described in Cell 4. It must be executed and must display an output. Try to keep the code simple (it can even be "1 + 1").

Cell 6 (rendered as Markdown): Using Markdown or HTML, this cell must include at least 3 of the following: horizontal rule, bulleted list, numbered list, tables, hyperlinks, images, code/syntax highlighting, blocked quotes, strikethrough.

Your notebook gets downloaded.
Later upload to GitHub by following the instructions in the reading Getting Started with GitHub.

Further in the MySubmission tab of the assignment paste the GitHub link of the notebook in the URL textbox.

Steps to Complete the assignment in Watson Studio.
Leveraging Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio, you will create your own Jupyter Notebook (in English) and share it via a public link.

How to generate a publicly viewable share link for your Jupyter Notebook:

Step 1. With a Jupyter Notebook open on Watson Studio, first ensure that you have saved the Notebook, by going to "File", then "Save", as shown below.

Step 4. To ensure that everyone else can view your Notebook, you can visit the link yourself from an incognito or private window. Alternatively, you can log out of your Watson Studio account and try to visit the link and ensure you can see the content.
